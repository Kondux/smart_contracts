## Step-by-Step Guide

### **Step 1: Prepare Your KNDX and Helix Tokens**
Before you can start staking, make sure you have an adequate amount of KNDX tokens in your wallet. Remember, the minimum stake amount is 10M KNDX wei. You'll also need Helix tokens for withdrawal, as they must be burned at a 10,000:1 rate when withdrawing Kondux.

  #### **Step 1.1: Grant Approval for Staking Contract** 
  In order to stake your KNDX tokens, you must first grant approval for the staking contract to move KNDX on your behalf. To do this, navigate to the Kondux Staking platform and follow the on-screen prompts to authorize the smart contract to interact with your KNDX tokens.

### **Step 2: Connect Your Wallet to the Kondux Platform**
To begin staking, navigate to the Kondux Staking platform and connect your ERC20-compatible wallet (such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Ledger) by following the on-screen prompts.

### **Step 3: Choose Your Locking Period**
Select your preferred locking period from the available options: 30, 90, 180, or 365 days. Keep in mind that longer locking periods offer higher reward boosts.

### **Step 4: Stake Your KNDX Tokens**
Enter the desired amount of KNDX tokens you'd like to stake and confirm the transaction in your wallet. You'll then receive Helix tokens at a 10,000:1 ratio as a reward.

# APR Calculation and Boosts for End Users

In this guide, we'll explain how the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) calculation works for end users who stake KNDX tokens. We'll also discuss the various boosts available and provide examples for different scenarios.

## Basic APR Calculation

The basic APR for staking KNDX tokens is 25% per year. However, the actual APR you receive when unstaking your tokens depends on the time they remained staked. For example, if you stake your tokens for 6 months, you'll receive an APR of 12.5%.

## Boosts

There are several ways to boost your APR:

1. **Founder's NFT**: Owning a Founder's NFT gives you a 10% boost.
2. **kNFTs**: kNFTs can have boosts ranging from 1% to 5%. You can stack up to 5 kNFTs to increase your boost.
3. **Locking Periods**: Locking your stake for a specific period gives you an additional boost:
   - 30 days: 0% boost
   - 90 days: 1% boost
   - 180 days: 3% boost
   - 365 days: 9% boost

Please note that rewards and boosts can only be claimed by those who lock their KNDX by staking it.

## Examples

The following examples illustrate how the APR calculation works for an end user, simulating stakings of 10,000 KNDX tokens under different conditions:

### Example 1: No Boosts - Unstaking after 180 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with no boosts and unstake after 180 days, your APR for 180 days would be 6.25% (25% * 180/365), and your reward would be 625 KNDX tokens.

### Example 2: Founder's NFT Boost - Unstaking after 180 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with a Founder's NFT (10% boost) and unstake after 180 days, your APR for 180 days would be 6.875% (25% * 180/365 * (1 + 0.10)), and your reward would be 687.5 KNDX tokens.

### Example 3: kNFT Boosts - Unstaking after 180 days with one kNFT of 3% boost

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with one kNFT giving a 3% boost and unstake after 180 days, your APR for 180 days would be 6.4375% (25% * 180/365 * (1 + 0.03)), and your reward would be 643.75 KNDX tokens.

### Example 4: kNFT Boosts - Unstaking after 180 days with two kNFTs of 3% boost each

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with two kNFTs, each giving a 3% boost, and unstake after 180 days, your total boost would be 6%. The resulting APR for 180 days would be 6.625% (25% * 180/365 * (1 + 0.06)), and your reward would be 662.5 KNDX tokens.

### Example 5: Locking Period Boost - Unstaking after 180 days with a locking period of 180 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with a 180-day locking period (3% boost) and unstake after 180 days, your APR for 180 days would be 6.4375% (25% * 180/365 * (1 + 0.03)), and your reward would be 643.75 KNDX tokens.

### Example 6: Combination of Boosts - Unstaking after 180 days with Founder's NFT and a locking period of 180 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with a Founder's NFT (10% boost) and a 180-day locking period (3% boost), your total boost would be 13%. The resulting APR for 180 days would be 7.0625% (25% * 180/365 * (1 + 0.13)), and your reward would be 706 KNDX tokens.

### Example 7: Combination of Boosts - Unstaking after 180 days with Founder's NFT, kNFT, and a locking period of 180 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with a Founder's NFT (10% boost), one kNFT with a 3% boost, and a 180-day locking period (3% boost), your total boost would be 16%. The resulting APR for 180 days would be 7.25% (25% * 180/365 * (1 + 0.16)), and your reward would be 725 KNDX tokens.

### Example 8: Combination of Boosts - Unstaking after 180 days with Founder's NFT, two kNFTs with 3% boost each, and a locking period of 180 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with a Founder's NFT (10% boost), two kNFTs each with a 3% boost, and a 180-day locking period (3% boost), your total boost would be 19%. The resulting APR for 180 days would be 7.4375% (25% * 180/365 * (1 + 0.19)), and your reward would be 743.75 KNDX tokens.

### Example 9: Combination of Boosts - Unstaking after 180 days with Founder's NFT, three kNFTs with 3% boost each, and a locking period of 180 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with a Founder's NFT (10% boost), three kNFTs each with a 3% boost, and a 180-day locking period (3% boost), your total boost would be 22%. The resulting APR for 180 days would be 7.625% (25% * 180/365 * (1 + 0.22)), and your reward would be 762.5 KNDX tokens.

### Example 10: Combination of Boosts - Unstaking after 180 days with Founder's NFT, four kNFTs with 3% boost each, and a locking period of 180 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with a Founder's NFT (10% boost), four kNFTs each with a 3% boost, and a 180-day locking period (3% boost), your total boost would be 25%. The resulting APR for 180 days would be 7.8125% (25% * 180/365 * (1 + 0.25)), and your reward would be 781.25 KNDX tokens.

### Example 11: Combination of Boosts - Unstaking after 180 days with Founder's NFT, five kNFTs with 3% boost each, and a locking period of 180 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with a Founder's NFT (10% boost), five kNFTs each with a 3% boost, and a 180-day locking period (3% boost), your total boost would be 28%. The resulting APR for 180 days would be 8% (25% * 180/365 * (1 + 0.28)), and your reward would be 800 KNDX tokens.

### Example 12: Combination of Boosts - Unstaking after 120 days with Founder's NFT, six kNFTs (5% + 5% + 4% + 3% + 2%), and a locking period of 180 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with a Founder's NFT (10% boost), six kNFTs with boosts of 5%, 5%, 4%, 3%, and 2% (only the top 5 boosts count), and a 180-day locking period (3% boost), your total boost would be 27%. The resulting APR for 120 days would be 5% (25% * 120/365 * (1 + 0.27)). However, since you unstake earlier than the locking period, you will lose all the bonuses and be penalized.

The remaining locking period is 60 days (180 - 120). The penalty percentage is 10% * (60 / 180) = 3.33%. Since the minimum penalty is 1%, the penalty applied will be 3.33%.

The final APR after penalties for 120 days would be 1.67% (5% - 3.33%), and your reward would be 167 KNDX tokens.

### Example 13: Combination of Boosts - Unstaking after 240 days with Founder's NFT, seven kNFTs (5% + 5% + 4% + 3% + 2%), and a locking period of 365 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with a Founder's NFT (10% boost), seven kNFTs with boosts of 5%, 5%, 4%, 3%, and 2% (only the top 5 boosts count), and a 365-day locking period (9% boost), your total boost would be 33%. The resulting APR for 240 days would be 16.25% (25% * 240/365 * (1 + 0.33)). However, since you unstake earlier than the locking period, you will lose all the bonuses and be penalized.

The remaining locking period is 125 days (365 - 240). The penalty percentage is 10% * (125 / 365) = 3.42%. Since the minimum penalty is 1%, the penalty applied will be 3.42%.

The final APR after penalties for 240 days would be 12.83% (16.25% - 3.42%), and your reward would be 1,283 KNDX tokens.

### Example 14: Combination of Boosts - Unstaking after 45 days with Founder's NFT, eight kNFTs (5% + 5% + 4% + 3% + 2%), and a locking period of 90 days

If you stake 10,000 KNDX tokens with a Founder's NFT (10% boost), eight kNFTs with boosts of 5%, 5%, 4%, 3%, and 2% (only the top 5 boosts count), and a 90-day locking period (1% boost), your total boost would be 25%. The resulting APR for 45 days would be 1.5625% (25% * 45/365 * (1 + 0.25)). However, since you unstake earlier than the locking period, you will lose all the bonuses and be penalized.

The remaining locking period is 45 days (90 - 45). The penalty percentage is 10% * (45 / 90) = 5%.

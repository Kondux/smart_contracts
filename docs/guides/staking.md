### **Step 1: Prepare Your KNDX and Helix Tokens**
Before you can start staking, make sure you have an adequate amount of KNDX tokens in your wallet. Remember, the minimum stake amount is 10M KNDX wei. You'll also need Helix tokens for withdrawal, as they must be burned at a 10,000:1 rate when withdrawing Kondux.

  #### **Step 1.1: Grant Approval for Staking Contract** 
  In order to stake your KNDX tokens, you must first grant approval for the staking contract to move KNDX on your behalf. To do this, navigate to the Kondux Staking platform and follow the on-screen prompts to authorize the smart contract to interact with your KNDX tokens.

### **Step 2: Connect Your Wallet to the Kondux Platform**
To begin staking, navigate to the Kondux Staking platform and connect your ERC20-compatible wallet (such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Ledger) by following the on-screen prompts.

### **Step 3: Choose Your Locking Period**
Select your preferred locking period from the available options: 30, 90, 180, or 365 days. Keep in mind that longer locking periods offer higher reward boosts.

### **Step 4: Stake Your KNDX Tokens**
Enter the desired amount of KNDX tokens you'd like to stake and confirm the transaction in your wallet. You'll then receive Helix tokens at a 10,000:1 ratio as a reward.

Monitor your staking position on the Kondux platform. You can view your rewards, as well as any NFT bonuses you may have earned. Compounding occurs every 24 hours, further boosting your earnings.

When you're ready to withdraw your Kondux, ensure you have enough Helix tokens in your wallet. Remember, you'll need to burn Helix tokens at the 10,000:1 rate to complete the withdrawal process. Note that a 1% withdrawal fee applies.

### **Step 7: Optimize Your NFT Bonuses**
To take full advantage of the Kondux Staking Smart Contract, consider collecting Founder's NFTs and kNFTs to boost your rewards even further:

- **Founder's NFT:** Holding a Founder's NFT grants you a 10% boost on your rewards.
